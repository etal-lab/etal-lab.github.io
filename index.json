Examples include brine discharge from desalination plants and cooled water from liquefied natural gas plants. In general, there exists an ambient current which can approach the jet at an arbitrary angle; the resulting dense jet will then have a three-dimensional trajectory. We present an experimental investigation on 60° dense jets discharged into a perpendicular current. The tracer concentration field is measured at selected cross-sections using the Laser induced-fluorescence (LIF) method. Jet detrainment from the dense jet is observed; the detrained jet fluid is advected horizontally downstream by the crossflow. Compared to predictions of a validated integral jet model that does not account for jet detrainment, it is found that the horizontal jet penetration in the momentum plane is consistently under-predicted by about 35 percent, while the jet trajectory in the buoyancy plane and the near field dilution in the bent-over dense jet are reasonably well-predicted.","tags":[],"title":"The Near-field Jet Behavior of 60° Dense Jets Discharged Into A Perpendicular Crossflow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris CK Lai","Joseph HW Lee","KM Lam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230786000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230786000,"objectID":"5a2695f58e1e6da89ad1171e1ed81f58","permalink":"https://etal-lab.github.io/publication/digital-simulation-of-dominant-eddies/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/digital-simulation-of-dominant-eddies/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper described a method for virtual construction of turbulent jet flow field from a limited set of experimental data. The objective is for jet visualization enhancement in near-field plume models. The method is based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), which is an efficient tool to capture the turbulent field based on principal components. A set of experimental flow images at a number of cross-sections of a coflowing jet is obtained in the laboratory. Four hundred instantaneous flow images are taken at each jet section and are subjected to POD analysis. The first 60 principal modes are used in the reconstruction of jet turbulence via a low dimensional generation of jet images. The inclusion of additional modes is shown to produce little improvement on the visual appearance of the reconstructed jet images. Linear interpolation is attempted to generate jet images at an intermediate jet section between two experimental stations. Jet flow field on a central longitudinal section of the jet are assembled from the reconstructed flow images at all jet sections. The resulting development of concentration jet width is shown to agree well with the analytical solution.","tags":[],"title":"Digital Simulation of Dominant Eddies of A Co-Flowing Jet","type":"publication"}]
