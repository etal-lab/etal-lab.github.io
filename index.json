Surface water enters the soil layer via infiltration and eventually becomes part of the groundwater flow. Apart from soil properties, the infiltration rate is highly dependent on the structures of the turbulent boundary layer adjacent to the porous bed. For sand beds with pore sizes of about 1mm, recent numerical studies found that the flow inside the pore matrix can become transitional and departs from the laminar Darcy flow regime; the Darcy coefficient is a function of the pore flow’s Reynolds number. Dispersion characteristics also change due to the change in flow regime. The project goal is to understand the different flow regimes and physics as a function of pore size and pore matrix using laboratory experiments.

In these flows, one or more heterogeneous materials is/are transported by a turbulent carrier fluid (fluid, hereafter). Their interactions, as embodied in the fluid velocities, determine the final fate and transport of the heterogeneous materials. This dissertation investigates how turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is created and injected into surrounding fluid by the rising bubbles in an air-water bubble plume. This analogue flow shares many similar fluid mechanical properties with oil well blowout plumes whose knowledge is important in disaster management. A comprehensive experimental program using acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) and planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) has been carried out to measure fluid velocities inside the time-steady two-phase plume. Radial profiles of diffusion of TKE and turbulent dissipation rate are reported for the first time. From the fluid-phase TKE budget, it is found that approximately 55-60% of the total work done by bubbles is used to create turbulence in the carrier fluid. Results on the auto-spectral density function of velocity fluctuations reveal a -8/3 spectral slope instead of the classic Kolmogorov-Richardson value of -5/3, suggesting a fundamental difference in spectral energy transfer in this two-phase ow when compared to other simple boundary-layer shear flows, such as a singe-phase jet. This is supported by the subgrid scale (SGS) dissipation computed from the PIV data where it can be seen that the direction of energy cascade is always forward for a simple jet whereas it can be backward for the two-phase plume. On the other hand, a data interpolation method based on first-order autoregressive processes is developed to replace faulty or missing data in a time series of turbulent velocities. The method is shown to preserve both spectral slopes and energies of frequency components, for the range of slopes between -7/6 to -8/3. Further, the classical sample and hold interpolation is shown to be the limiting behavior of a first-order autoregressive process and therefore has theoretical underpinnings hitherto unknown in the literature.","tags":["Bubble plumes","two-phase flows","turbulence","energy cascade","velocity spectra","data interpolation"],"title":"An Analysis of Bubble Plumes in Unstratified Stagnant Water","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruño Fraga","Thorsten Stoesser","Chris CK Lai","Scott A Socolofsky"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1447113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1447113600,"objectID":"3c71054859d9870e991cd92dfa04a764","permalink":"https://etal-lab.github.io/publication/les-based/","publishdate":"2015-11-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/les-based/","section":"publication","summary":"An approach for Eulerian–Lagrangian large-eddy simulation of bubble plume dynamics is presented and its performance evaluated.","tags":["Bubble plumes","Large-eddy simulation","Lagrangian Particle Tracking","Two-way coupling","Slip velocity","Delta functions"],"title":"A LES-based Eulerian–Lagrangian approach to predict the dynamics of bubble plumes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["KW Choi","Chris CK Lai","Joseph HW Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1437436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437436800,"objectID":"33585b2644671b0500dedeb42fc8f4db","permalink":"https://etal-lab.github.io/publication/mixing-in-the-intermediate-field-of-dense-jets-in-cross-currents/","publishdate":"2015-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mixing-in-the-intermediate-field-of-dense-jets-in-cross-currents/","section":"publication","summary":"This study presents an experimental and numerical study for an inclined (60$^o$ to horizontal) dense jet discharged into a coflowing current.

The tracer concentration field is measured at selected cross-sections using the Laser induced-fluorescence (LIF) method. Jet detrainment from the dense jet is observed; the detrained jet fluid is advected horizontally downstream by the crossflow. Compared to predictions of a validated integral jet model that does not account for jet detrainment, it is found that the horizontal jet penetration in the momentum plane is consistently under-predicted by about 35 percent, while the jet trajectory in the buoyancy plane and the near field dilution in the bent-over dense jet are reasonably well-predicted.","tags":[],"title":"The Near-field Jet Behavior of 60° Dense Jets Discharged Into A Perpendicular Crossflow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris CK Lai","Joseph HW Lee","KM Lam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230786000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230786000,"objectID":"5a2695f58e1e6da89ad1171e1ed81f58","permalink":"https://etal-lab.github.io/publication/digital-simulation-of-dominant-eddies/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/digital-simulation-of-dominant-eddies/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper described a method for virtual construction of turbulent jet flow field from a limited set of experimental data.

A set of experimental flow images at a number of cross-sections of a coflowing jet is obtained in the laboratory. Four hundred instantaneous flow images are taken at each jet section and are subjected to POD analysis. The first 60 principal modes are used in the reconstruction of jet turbulence via a low dimensional generation of jet images. The inclusion of additional modes is shown to produce little improvement on the visual appearance of the reconstructed jet images. Linear interpolation is attempted to generate jet images at an intermediate jet section between two experimental stations. Jet flow field on a central longitudinal section of the jet are assembled from the reconstructed flow images at all jet sections.
